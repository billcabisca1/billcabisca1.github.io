  <body> <h1>William Cabisca</h1>
    <p>This  is my site</p>
    <p>Welcome to my website.I provide a wide range of services. I am always looking to upgrade my knowledge. I would like to start working with others on some of the ideas that I have. 
      These ideas include working on wearable technology such as augmented reality glasses. I am also in the process of writing several books that I feel will be able to help others out. One book is on tree trimming which I have over 20 years experience doing.
      I am also looking at writing a science fiction book that deals with time travel and some of the issues facing time travel.
      I would like to learn more about machine learning and artificial intelligence. 
    </p>
    <p> I went to South University for my BS in IT. This program gave me a basic understanding of some of the areas that are dealt with in information technology.
    It also opened the door for my introduction into computer programming. I am learning java, python, html,css, and a few other computer languages.
    I hope to use this education as I move ahead in my career path.</p>
    
    <p>I was a plant manager for a manufacturing company for over 6 years.  I did robotics programming while at that company. I was in charge of all operations that
    were necessarry for day to day operations. I also designed several products for that company that as far as I know are still on the market.I did 
      sales and purchasing as well as hiring and firing of employees. I enjoyed working on new designs and sourcing parts that were required for production.
      We were a technical production company that utilized the latest technologies for production runs. I was responsible to schedule any outside work that was done
      so that we could meet customer demands. 
    </p>
    <p> I worked as a hydraulic repair technician for several years as well. I repaired pumps, motors, cyclinders, valves and equipment. This is one of the reasons that I can operate heavy equipment so well. It also 
    helped having a father who had lots of heavy equipment. I worked off and on for my fathers companies most of my life as part time help filling in on jobs where my dad was understaffed.
    I can operate cranes, back hoes, loaders, dump trucks, bucket trucks, fork lifts, wood chippers, arial lifts, and most other equipment I can think of. 
    I enjoy working outside so this type of work suited me.</p>
         <p>    I started working in construction I was about 15 you know back in 1989 I did mainly decks and punch out work you know cleaning up after a crews. I worked with framers and roofers then I did that pretty much from the time I was 15 till I was 18 and then I went to nurses aid School and got my certified nursing assistant certificate. I worked at the Forest City nursing home Still Meadows, McKean County Nursing Home, as well as several of the nursing agencies. I did this for 4 or 5 years. I enjoyed this type of work helping people. I worked for Hospice</p>

  <p>  I went back into construction and did blacktop and paving. Hauling dirt, running Bobcats and backhoes for fathers business. I worked at a welding shop doing metal and plastic welding. I even worked for CSI. Not what you think,  Casket Shells Incorporated, welding and stamping casket shells. So I have worked a variety of Jobs. I enjoyed them all. I worked with a lot of interesting people and learned from each and everyone.</p> 

  <p>   I guess I have always worked for myself. I followed what skills my father taught me and translated those skills into getting my own work. I enjoyed working for myself. I liked the stability of working for other companies as well </p> 


       
  <p>    .I spent over 6 years as a plant manager for a manufacturing company. Jungle Jim’s accessory products. I started out as a welder and robotics operator. I watched this company go from a small 20 x 40 warehouse and the owners garage to its new state of the art factory. . I helped build this company from the ground up and was part of something cool.Jungle Jims still operates in Kentucky. At that company I did sales, purchasing, machine setups and programming. I managed 3 separate shifts and dealt with the outsourcing of products and services. I developed a couple products for the company while I was with them. I enjoyed proto typing and designing new fixtures for the welding robot. I am skilled at reading blueprints, schematics, and technical plans. I can read precise measuring equipment such as calipers, micrometers, and rulers. I have operated most types of hand tools available in manufacturing. </p> 



 <p>    It was after this that I got into tree trimming on a more full-time basis I worked for my father trimming trees as well as working for myself I worked for Townsend, Asplund,Nelson, and other tree companies. I work for my father's Company, Louisville Tree Service .I work for Kentucky Tree. I work for Alvey's lawn and Tree Service.I work for Mike Hurst and I worked for myself like I said. I have done all types of tree work working from buckets and cranes to running stump grinders and loaders. After doing this for well over 20 years I've torn up my shoulder and still have neck and problems with my other shoulders needless to say I still want the climb I enjoyed making the money and the challenge of it </p> 


<p>For about the last 10 years I was a full time caregiver to my grandchildren that we have took care of.  I am looking to try to get into a company that is less physical than climbing trees. I wouldn’t even mind a desk at my age. I play  guitar and drums. I enjoy music. I am trying to write some books that I feel others will want to read. I am trying to pass along some of my skills to others. I am trying to stay current with technology since  my education was in Information technology.  I went to South University working on BS in IT. I want to keep my web page current and up to date as I can. I am working on learning python, html, css, and other programming languages. I still feel as if I have so much to learn. With all I know, I know even less. I am also trying to beef up my github projects. </p>
