    <p>This  is my site</p>
    <p>Welcome to my website.I provide a wide range of services. I am always looking to upgrade my knowledge. I would like to start working with others on some of the ideas that I have. 
      These ideas include working on wearable technology such as augmented reality glasses. I am also in the process of writing several books that I feel will be able to help others out. One book is on tree trimming which I have over 20 years experience doing.
      I am also looking at writing a science fiction book that deals with time travel and some of the issues facing time travel.
      I would like to learn more about machine learning and artificial intelligence. 
    </p>
    <p> I went to South University for my BS in IT. This program gave me a basic understanding of some of the areas that are dealt with in information technology.
    It also opened the door for my introduction into computer programming. I am learning java, python, html,css, and a few other computer languages.
    I hope to use this education as I move ahead in my career path.</p>
    
    <p>I was a plant manager for a manufacturing company for over 6 years.  I did robotics programming while at that company. I was in charge of all operations that
    were necessarry for day to day operations. I also designed several products for that company that as far as I know are still on the market.I did 
      sales and purchasing as well as hiring and firing of employees. I enjoyed working on new designs and sourcing parts that were required for production.
      We were a technical production company that utilized the latest technologies for production runs. I was responsible to schedule any outside work that was done
      so that we could meet customer demands. 
    </p>
    <p> I worked as a hydraulic repair technician for several years as well. I repaired pumps, motors, cyclinders, valves and equipment. This is one of the reasons that I can operate heavy equipment so well. It also 
    helped having a father who had lots of heavy equipment. I worked off and on for my fathers companies most of my life as part time help filling in on jobs where my dad was understaffed.
    I can operate cranes, back hoes, loaders, dump trucks, bucket trucks, fork lifts, wood chippers, arial lifts, and most other equipment I can think of. 
    I enjoy working outside so this type of work suited me.</p>
